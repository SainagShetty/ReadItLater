    "text": "Google is rejoining the Internet of Things platform wars. Today at its\u00A0Google I/O conference, the company announced Brillo, the \"underlying operating system for the internet of things,\" with a developer preview coming in Q3 of this year. Brillo is \"derived\" from Android but \"polished\" to just the lower levels. It supports Wi-Fi, Bluetooth Low Energy, and other Android things.\nAdditionally there's Weave, the (cross platform) common language that will let Brillo devices, phones, and the internet all talk to one another \u2014 that's coming in Q4. Android devices will auto-detect Brillo and Weave devices. Here's a helpful chart to explain the relation:\nUp until this point, Google has been somewhat quiet on its smart home / internet of things plans \u2014 especially since\u00A0the company acquired Nest early last year. The name Brillo was mentioned last week in a\u00A0report from The Intercept  about Google developing software that can run on very low-power devices and communicate with other connected devices nearby.\n"
