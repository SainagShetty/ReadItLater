    "text": "If you've bought a car in the last decade, you probably think of \"infotainment\" as a four-letter word.\nThe touchscreens in the centers of our dashboards have been, to put it bluntly, bad. In some ways, they're finally starting to catching up: the user interfaces are crawling, slowly, out of the stone age. They're getting bigger, which makes them easier to see and to use. Touch response times are getting better. And with the advent of CarPlay and Android Auto, there's a decent way to use our smartphones on the road without endangering the lives of everyone around us. Still, there's a lot of work to do.\nThat's where people like GM's Phil Abram come into play. Abram \u2014\u00A0who has stints at Sonos and Sony on his r\u00E9sum\u00E9 \u2014 led the company's adoption of CarPlay and Android Auto,\u00A0which will eventually reach just about every vehicle GM sells in the US. He's also coming off a connected car deployment in China after rolling out in Europe and North America, where LTE currently ships on 16 models.\nBut the challenges still loom large: as we discovered in our own reviews, neither CarPlay nor Android Auto are perfect, nor is the hardware that lies underneath. We sat down with Abram this week to find out where he stands on the connected car \u2014\u00A0and how it'll change in the age of smartphones, ubiquitous high-speed data, Tesla, and the upcoming Chevy Bolt.\nChris Ziegler: My understanding is that you led the integration efforts for Android Auto and CarPlay, is that right?\nPhil Abram: Yes. Our team did that, yeah.\nSo tell me a little bit about that process, because you have some that are hitting in March of next year, right? March or April?\nWell, we have vehicles today with both Android Auto and Apple CarPlay, and then we have one infotainment system that we\u2019re putting in place that the specification for the Android Auto lagged a little bit, and so we delivered it to the marketplace with Apple CarPlay and we\u2019ll have a software update available for those vehicles in the early part of the first quarter of next year.\nSo the majority of our vehicle fleet by that point in time will be enabled. New cars will be enabled with both.\nDo you have a date or a vision of a date for when you\u2019ll be at 100 percent \u2014\u00A0if not Android Auto and CarPlay compatibility, at least having a touchscreen in the center stack?\nI don\u2019t know if we\u2019ll ever reach 100 percent, simply because \u2014 and I\u2019m thinking on a global basis as well \u2014 we have radio delete in a lot of markets because they want as low a cost vehicle as they can get. An 8-inch color in a car costs money, and for some people they don\u2019t want to make that investment. Right? For all the benefits that it has, it\u2019s a personal choice, and so we try to accommodate and make sure our vehicles are accessible to people in a broad range of needs and income and what they can put into a vehicle.\nOver 70 percent of our global volume will probably be enabled within the next two years. Now, whether the markets they\u2019re in support that is determinant on the rollout by Apple and Google of when they\u2019re enabling different markets.\nDoes the specter of a Google car and an Apple car affect your strategy for supporting these systems? Do you think of it as a trojan horse of sorts?\nNot at all. Because the amount of code that\u2019s actually in our vehicles \u2014\u00A0well, none of it comes from Apple or Google, first and foremost. They have a specification, and that code is what we implement to meet their specification.\nAnd all of the processing power is on the phone?\nCorrect, right. For those applications that they do. But they don\u2019t do HVAC, they don\u2019t do vehicle health, they don\u2019t do many of the other things that are relevant and important to people in their vehicle. It\u2019s a \"plus,\" it\u2019s an \"and,\" it\u2019s not an \"or\" situation for us.\nSmartphones are a part of people\u2019s lives. If we claim to be a customer-centric organization, if we truly are, then we gotta to say, hey, that\u2019s important in their lives. We have to make sure that it works, and we work with it as best we can. And today, as defined, that is the best integration, the best experience for people, because we worked with Apple and Google on making it that.\nBut that doesn\u2019t mean we\u2019re ceding our control of the in-vehicle experience to them. They\u2019re not doing our infotainment systems. Much of the reporting on this is, I think, somewhat sensationalized because it\u2019s a much better story to create this looming threat and this battle for the dashboard, or the in-car experience between these industry titans. That\u2019s not the reality of it. We\u2019re all saying, hey, how can we make the experience relevant, safe, and inviting for our collective customers? That\u2019s really where we\u2019re going with that.\nWe work with Apple and Google as closely as any of the other auto manufacturers. We\u2019re a founding member of the OAA [Open Automotive Alliance]. We\u2019re the first one to put Siri into a car. We\u2019re going to have this on over 33 different models, and Tim Cook stood on stage and said there\u2019d be 40 models with Apple CarPlay in them. So there are probably more than that, but we\u2019re embracing this. We\u2019re not saying we\u2019re going to carve out something and try to protect by not doing. That\u2019s a sure path to inevitable obsolescence. I\u2019ve been at companies that did that. We\u2019re embracing it. And what it says is, hey, we believe there are experiences in the car that can\u2019t be delivered through phone integration, and we\u2019re going to deliver those.\nCan you give me some examples?\nVehicle health management. The things we\u2019re doing with proactive alerts, we\u2019re going to be extending that more into the vehicle. So the vehicle is able to communicate to you more about its health and status than it does today, rather than with the orange \"check engine\" light, which is not particularly informative. You can\u2019t do that with phone projection. So there are a number of things that we\u2019re working on that really express what we call \"the \u2018carness\u2019 of the car.\"\nThe phone does four things really well inside the vehicle: phone, messaging, media, and navigation. That\u2019s it. So everything else is really better served with taking the embedded systems and making sure that they\u2019re capable of doing that. And, as we\u2019re talking about connected car, the car itself needs to be on the grid and connected. And if you rely solely on the phone, the moment you leave the car with that, the car goes back to being a brick. That doesn\u2019t make sense.\nThe car needs to be on the grid, it has to be part of the world around it, part of the ecosystem within it. And so to unlock a car, for example, remotely: if you\u2019re relying on the phone and the car is the major way of doing it, and you\u2019ve got the phone in your hand, you\u2019re kind of screwed. So that\u2019s why it\u2019s more than just those four applications in the car.\nBut in iOS 9, CarPlay now supports vehicle apps that can appear as part of the phone projection, right? And Android Auto already had that capability.\nNeither of them have fully released the SDKs. And by the way, we\u2019re the ones that drove them to do that. They weren\u2019t planning on doing that until GM went to them and said, hey guys, for applications that make sense in that world, we want to be able to have an app that shows up as part of that experience.\nApple in particular, they don\u2019t have a general SDK to allow developers in; it\u2019s a little bit more narrow. Google is taking that approach more so than Apple. But I said, we want to have our application be presented through the phone integration like your phone or your navigation and the like. And so that\u2019s why we worked with them to develop that.\nThere are capabilities that we want to leverage. We have our RemoteLink application on the phone, and it has a number of capabilities. We want some of that experience available when people are in the car, as well as today it\u2019s on the outside of the car. Well, the best way to do that is to leverage phone integration, and so that\u2019s why we worked with Apple and Google to do that. But you can\u2019t do certain things, because the phone \u2014 regardless of what the people in Germany say \u2014 has a very, very limited set of vehicle data that\u2019s available to it. There are six data elements that are available to it. So that inherently makes it not a good place to try to do deep vehicle integration.\n  \"The car needs to be on the grid, it has to be part of the world around it, part of the ecosystem within it.\"  \nAre you aware of any plans to expand the level of data that is available to the phone? Could we see a future system where that integration is tighter than it is today?\nNot at this time, no.\nI\u2019ve only spent a very brief time with both of these systems, but I find that it\u2019s a little distracting to have to switch between two worlds, right? You have the phone integration world, and then there are certain functions that may or may not be obvious that you need to exit from that system to get to. How do you solve that problem, or do you see it as a problem?\nI think it\u2019s a transitional state, and we\u2019re working with them to make that make more sense, more seamless in that regard. Not to hold up what we\u2019re currently doing as the world\u2019s best experience, but if you switch between navigation and audio in a car today, and even on a phone, if you move between these applications, you move between experiences. We\u2019re working on making that a little more seamless, but I don\u2019t find it jarring. But I think there\u2019s room for us to improve on that for sure.\nI believe you have a low-end infotainment system that relies very heavily on the phone, is that right?\nThat one does rely more on phone integration. Like, there\u2019s not a nav option for it, because we\u2019re like, okay, for cost and for what people are using this device for, that doesn\u2019t make sense for us to create another derivative with the nav option, particularly in the United States market. So we are leveraging the phone as the nav solution for those vehicles, if you will.\nOther vehicles where we can invest more and there\u2019s more opportunity, we are offering embedded nav because it has closer integration with the rest of the vehicle operation. We sell cars that go from $13,000 up to $100,000. The range and needs and customers that are across that spectrum are pretty broad, and so we do a lot of things to meet those needs with those particular systems in those particular applications, and what the expectations of the customer are getting into each of those cars. And we want to exceed those expectations, and frankly, if it\u2019s on a Cadillac, they\u2019re going to expect an embedded navigation option.\n  \"...frankly, if it\u2019s on a Cadillac, they\u2019re going to expect an embedded navigation option.\"  \nI have a car with CarPlay on it and an embedded nav system. The embedded nav system is still just easier for me to use. It just is, because I just get in the car and go. Now, for other people that won\u2019t be the experience that they want. This is about an \"and,\" not an \"or\" type of situation.\nThat being said, it\u2019s interesting to me that a [Chevy] Spark customer is just as likely to have an iPhone as a [Corvette Stingray] Z06 customer, or a [Cadillac] CT6 customer. And that experience for them is the same. Obviously, the experience in the interior of a $30,000 vehicle is going to be different from a $100,000 vehicle, but does that same logic also necessarily apply to the center stack? You have a very different experience in [Cadillac] Cue than you do in, say, Chevy MyLink. But I\u2019m wondering if maybe that\u2019s a place where you need as much differentiation as you do in, say, the materials in the interior.\nIt has to be meaningful differentiation. And frankly, where we were as a company was gratuitous differentiation that didn\u2019t actually add value to the customer or support the brand. And I like to say, there\u2019s one good way to make a phone call. You don\u2019t need to differentiate on how you make a phone call in a car with hands-free between a Sonic and a CT6. You don\u2019t need to, so don\u2019t apply effort and resources and add complexity to the overall system by doing so.\nThere is no need to try to differentiate between a Sonic and a Z06 when it comes to phone integration. There\u2019s just not. There\u2019s so many other places. Like there\u2019s a PDR [Performance Data Recorder] in a Z06. You\u2019re not going to find one of those in a Spark, or else you\u2019d be really disappointed with the results! [Laughter.] But there\u2019s a differentiation because it\u2019s meaningful, it\u2019s relevant to the expectations of the customer.\nThat\u2019s why we\u2019re putting phone integration so broadly \u2014 because yeah, almost all of our customers have cellphones and smartphones. They use them differently. Their experiences and expectations of them are different. Like the phones themselves \u2014\u00A0if I took your phone and compared it to my phone, they\u2019re going to be different, because they reflect who we are and our expectations and how I use my phone. There are a lot of things that are the same \u2014 a core set. We surf the internet the same, we answer the phone the same way, we use contacts the same way. But beyond that core set, it varies greatly in terms of how we use the phone, and frankly our expectations of what a phone is.\nLikewise, what we\u2019re doing with the car is kind of the same way. There\u2019s certain stuff that\u2019s table stakes, and then beyond that, that\u2019s where you find the opportunity to express the brand and the vehicle\u2019s intent more fully.\nI think this is a really fascinating time for infotainment and the human-machine interface in the car. Like Audi is doing some interesting things where they\u2019re moving everything to the instrument cluster, they don\u2019t even have a center stack in some vehicles. Acura has two touchscreens in the center stack now. What are some of the technologies on the horizon that you think are exciting or going to be game-changers that aren\u2019t necessarily ready for market today?\nThat I can talk about? I think voice has a long way to go in the car, and really, far-field auto environment voice has got a lot of room for improvement, and as it does, it\u2019s going to greatly change the experience in the vehicle. We\u2019re probably going to have to go back and try to engage people again that had bad voice experiences, and have given up on that to try to get them back into that as we make improvements in that area.\nI don\u2019t particularly think gesture [control] is terribly relevant, because it\u2019s such a closed-in space. But the moment you take your hand off the wheel, to even make a gesture, the difference between that and interacting with something in a physical way is a pretty small gap that you\u2019re going to jump there. Why add to the complexity of knowing what those gestures are and getting them squared away, because you\u2019re going to have to confirm it somehow, right? Did it get the gesture right? So I\u2019m not quite sure it\u2019s a big solution for us, that one I\u2019m kind of ambivalent about. I haven\u2019t seen something that isn\u2019t just gratuitous.\nAnd that\u2019s what we have to guard against. One of our suppliers of technology brought out their demo car and we\u2019re sitting in the demo car, and he says, \"Hey Phil, push the voice command and tell it to roll down the windows.\" And so I push the button, and I wait two seconds and it beeps, and I say, \"Roll down the windows,\" and it rolls down the window.\nWhy wouldn\u2019t you just push the button?\nRight? Is there a customer need to roll down the windows? Yes. Is it an unmet need? No. And I can roll down them all from right here with one push. It\u2019s an interesting application of technology to solve a problem that\u2019s already been fully solved. Now, if you can take that technology and find something where people have a gap between what their experience is and what the ideal is, yeah, that\u2019s where you go for.\nAnd so, frankly, we\u2019ve done it, and we see a lot of people who are talking technology do it. But throwing technology at problems that are already fully solved or the application of technology to them doesn\u2019t actually move the ball down the field\u2026 it creates more confusion and anxiety or complexity in systems, when we all know that the art is in driving simplicity in highly functional things.\nThe innovation is going to be in terms of how you deliver higher operational functionality with lower and lower complexity to it, by getting the car smarter, by leveraging cloud off-boarding much more, to be more predictive, to be more anticipative. That\u2019s an area where I think we have a lot of runway and we\u2019ll change people\u2019s experiences in ways that are very subtle at first and then you\u2019ll stop and look back and say, wow, we\u2019ve come a long way, but we didn\u2019t notice that we moved along in that journey because things had just gotten easier. And once they\u2019re easier, you come to expect that, and it doesn\u2019t seem that revelational.\nIt seems like that journey is a learning process both for customers and for automakers. And one thing that sticks out in my mind is that Lincoln in their last-generation MyLincoln Touch system, it was entirely touch in the center stack. And in their most recent vehicles, they\u2019ve moved back to some knobs. And of course Tesla has had this debate white-hot for the past several years with their giant touchscreen and no knobs at all. You mentioned the power windows example, but what is the ongoing role of tactile control for the driver versus, say, touchscreens? Do you have a bright line between functions should be controllable with physical control versus what can be controlled via voice control or touch?\nMost of them tend to be redundant for a couple reasons. Sometimes, in certain situations, I\u2019ll use rotary knobs, and other times I\u2019ll use steering wheel controls, sometimes I\u2019ll use voice. And it\u2019s almost a per-case basis as to what\u2019s the most appropriate for that function and moment in time that surrounds it. There\u2019s not a universality to that. If I\u2019m sitting parked somewhere and scrolling through stuff, I\u2019m going to use the touchscreen all day long, because that\u2019s far better than knobs or voice. It\u2019s just very convenient and very easy for me to use. And so I\u2019m waiting to pick up something at the store, my wife ran in for something, and I\u2019m scrolling through something \u2014 that\u2019s a great experience, as opposed to going down the road doing 80 miles per hour, 75 miles per hour, 70 miles per hour, that\u2019s probably not the right experience and we lock some of that out.\nThe one thing about the car environment that\u2019s different than a smartphone is the car environment is highly contextual. Some of that context could be driving fast, could be sitting still, but there\u2019s very distinct differences between that and how you have to experience and interact with the car. With a smartphone, it\u2019s pan-experiential. It\u2019s almost devoice of context, intentionally so. It wants to be the chameleon, it wants to move and change. Its purpose and intent is to draw you into it, to absorb you into it, and the car is the exact opposite of that. Different times, different applications. So there aren\u2019t any bright lines. We have those raging debates ourselves. The designers hate knobs. People seem to still like them, and for certain applications like our Cadillac Cue system \u2014 volume up-down is a slide, it\u2019s a swipe on that. It\u2019s a little rough! That\u2019s not precise, or you can use the steering wheel controls, but people still like the knob to turn things up and down. So for that purpose, there\u2019s a great application for that. Now will that change in ten years as people become used to something else? Sure, but right now it\u2019s going to be a mix of rotary controls.\nIt depends on the car, the reach zone of a car, too. Right? With certain cars \u2014 in a Spark, putting a rotary control in makes very little sense because you can almost touch all four windows without moving. Now, in a CT6 or another vehicle where the hood lines are much further out, rotary controls make a lot more sense. So it\u2019s the dynamic of the car. All of these things play into what is right in that regard. So there is not a single answer.\nDo you think that you will get to full over-the-air updatability of your systems? You have LTE in virtually every car that rolls off your line, at least in the US and a few other markets. Are you approaching that point where taking your car into the dealership for, say, the Android Auto update is a thing of the past?\nWe\u2019re moving that direction, we\u2019re not there today. Certain parts, really bluntly, certain parts of the vehicle were designed to be updated over the air, other parts of the vehicle weren\u2019t designed to be updated over the air. And the designs of those and how they iterate in vehicle systems that are \u2014\u00A0I don\u2019t know, 80 ECUs [electronic control units] in a vehicle, right? How many of those were designed from scratch to be updated over the air or just iterated from a prior world where it wasn\u2019t connected?\nSo, for example, we\u2019ve been updating the OnStar module \u2014\u00A0what we call the VCP \u2014\u00A0in a vehicle for years, because by its very nature it\u2019s a connected device. By the fact that it\u2019s on a carrier\u2019s network means we have to be able to keep up with those things. And we\u2019ve done other things with that. So we\u2019ve been updating parts of a car for many, many years. We do it very frequently, we just don\u2019t make pronouncements about it. We want to do it so people don\u2019t need to know, it\u2019s just done for them and it\u2019s just magic that their car keeps working. Even though the world around them is changing, the car keeps working. We\u2019ve done other body modules and control modules in the vehicle, we\u2019ve updated them over the air because they were capable of doing that.\nSo we\u2019re going to keep building on that list of items or parts of the vehicle that are capable of doing that, and working through all of the infrastructure that needs to be in place in order to do that effectively.\nSo let\u2019s switch gears a little bit. The DMCA exemption came through this week, and I know that GM had been one of many automakers that had misgivings about that exemption. What are the short-term and long-term implications for you? Are you more worried now that people are going to screw up their car in some way that makes it unsafe, or do you think that you can safeguard that while still playing within the bounds of the exemption?\nI don\u2019t have an easy answer for it, because we have to understand what exactly that means, what we have to do in response to that. But first and foremost is what you said \u2014 a car is a car, and making sure that it is still safely a car. We talk about being customer centric, well, some of the time that means keeping people from harming themselves, because they don\u2019t understand what it means to build a car. That\u2019s what we\u2019re here for, right? We have that expertise. So there\u2019s not a short list of answers on that. I think we\u2019re still evaluating exactly what that means and what we have to do to respond to it, and what the implications are to our customers and making sure that we\u2019re balancing all of those things.\nThere\u2019s some conversation happening right now that Google is working on, beyond Android Auto, a full-fledged Android-based platform for the car, perhaps along the lines of what QNX does. Is that something that you would consider at some point?\nWe\u2019re not an operating system company. We aren\u2019t going to write our own operating system, so we will always be getting an operating system from somebody, whether it\u2019s Linux-based, or it\u2019s QNX-based, or it\u2019s WinCE-based, or it\u2019s Android-based. And as such, we\u2019ll evaluate and look at the pros and cons and the values of each one of those for what our intended purpose is. How will they handle real-time? Because right now, Android doesn\u2019t do real-time so well, or not at all. Boot times, all of these things are very relevant and important to that, and if they have a solution to that that we think has strengths and benefits to that and has the right commercial implications, we\u2019ll certainly look at it.\nBut to me, I consider an operating system a little bit like transmission fluid. As a company, we want to make sure we pick the right transmission fluid so that the transmissions run as well as anybody else and it\u2019s got all the benefits and the pros and cons of it, right? Will we ever talk about that transmission fluid to a customer? No. What we\u2019re going to talk about is, hey, your car shifts quieter, it gets better gas mileage, you don\u2019t have to worry about your transmission, the car is more durable. But you don\u2019t talk about the fluid, you just talk about the results. We don\u2019t talk about what cars of ours have QNX, which have Linux, which has whatever else in it, because that\u2019s not relevant to the car nor will it ever be. What\u2019s relevant is what the car can do for them, and we\u2019ll continue to express that.\nThat being said, Android is a brand that people recognize, in a way that Linux and QNX aren\u2019t. Well, Linux maybe, for some people.\nBut the relevance of that to the vehicle experience\u2026 there will never be millions of an apps for a vehicle, simply because a vehicle is not a smartphone. It\u2019s not a smartphone on wheels, it\u2019s a car. It\u2019s a vehicle. It is what it is. And the applications that are going to be in that vehicle \u2014\u00A0going back to talking about relevancy and contextually applicability, you don\u2019t need ten flashlight apps and a few beer chugging apps in the car.\nThe value of that device \u2014\u00A0you can separate the hardware from the platform of it, right? 10 to 15 percent is the hardware, 85 to 90 percent is the \"platforminess\" of it. Because it is a platform, it\u2019s intended to be a platform, and that\u2019s what it\u2019s delivered as. So you can take and do whatever you want to do with it.\nA car is a car. A $50,000 car \u2014\u00A0the majority of the value of that vehicle is going to be defined by the vehicleness of it, right? How well it moves your stuff from here to there, the styling of it. Now, more and more, how you interact with it is moving up the charts. Believe me, that\u2019s why I\u2019m there, that\u2019s why I joined the company, because that changed. But it will always be within the context of it being a vehicle. It\u2019s not a general-purpose device.\nAnd so, talking about Android in the car means that if you\u2019re an Apple user, you\u2019re going to think that car\u2019s not for you. Well, that\u2019s not what we want to do, and it\u2019s untrue along with it. And we\u2019re a founding member of OAA. We\u2019ve been working with Google on Android variants for a long time, all nature of it. I doubt you\u2019ll ever see the little green guy on the dash of one of our cars, because it\u2019s not relevant to the purchasing criteria. It\u2019s not relevant to the expression of the benefits of the vehicle. We\u2019ve got to turn that into the benefits, because in a car, it\u2019s those benefits, it\u2019s not the platforminess of it.\nTo what extent do you have challenges keeping the various platforms GM has for infotainment across different brands in sync? You have GMC, you have Cadillac, you have\u2026\nYeah, global.\nAnd they\u2019re all slightly different UXes, right?\nYeah, right. We\u2019re working very hard to do that. We\u2019ve talked about all the transitions. If you go back maybe five years ago, there were 27 different suppliers of what you would consider radios or infotainment systems across GM\u2019s portfolio. And when it was speaker wire, power, and an antenna jack, it didn\u2019t make much difference. The interface between it and the car, the car and the user were interchangeable. And so every local market found a radio in the local market and jammed it into the dash of a car.\nAs we\u2019ve moved in towards being more and more integrated into the experience of a car, from 27 we\u2019re down around five or six now, we\u2019re converging that number, we\u2019re driving that number down. For the simple reasons of, one, the integration of it to the rest of the vehicle and the vehicle experiences is increasing, so that proliferation is death to that. Number two, we\u2019re creating connected systems, so now you\u2019ve got something between the vehicle and the outside world, so now if you multiply here, you\u2019ve got both sides now having to deal with that proliferation, which now you\u2019ve squared or doubled at least the impact of having that. So we\u2019re continuing to try to march that down to as few as we can, while allowing for meaningful differentiation between the brands and the vehicles.\nDo you think you\u2019ll need to get to the point where you have 100 percent, if not LTE, some form of connectivity in your vehicles that allows GM to push OTA updates?\nWe\u2019ve stated as a goal that we\u2019re going to actively connect all of our vehicles on a global basis. I think we said 2019, we\u2019d have over 75 percent of our fleet, global volume, connected in that time frame.\nAnd some of it is going to be market-driven. I\u2019m sorry, there\u2019s not a lot of 4G in Uzbekistan, however we have a huge market share \u2014\u00A0Chevrolet has a huge market share in Uzbekistan. It\u2019s going to be tough a 4G LTE carrier and deployment in a meaningful way in that market any time soon. We\u2019ve launched it in US and Canada, we launched it in Europe earlier this year, we\u2019ve launched it in China earlier this month. So China, Europe, US, Canada, that\u2019s a big chunk of volume on a global basis that will be 4G LTE connected and we\u2019ve launched OnStar in Brazil, not 4G but we\u2019re going to migrate to 4G because some of the network isn\u2019t where it needs to be in a lot of regards down there as well.\nSo we\u2019re going to keep on knocking them down and rolling it out and it\u2019s not going to be overnight, it\u2019s going to take several years, partly because of us, partly because of what the market readiness is for it.\n  \"[Tesla's] customers are essentially beta testers for them in a lot of regards. And people love it!\"  \n[GM executive vice president] Mark Reuss mentioned that mentioned that the Bolt is going to have an evolution of Chevrolet\u2019s infotainment system in some regard. What can you say about that, and more generally, how, if at all, will electrification affect how you think about infotainment systems?\nElectrification is a plus. The core needs of driving, whether it\u2019s an electric vehicle or a gas engine, are the same. The experience is going to be the same, and so for that, 95 percent commonality, we\u2019re going to have the same infotainment needs and have those met.\nNow electrification does present some new opportunities, because of the very nature of it and the information that you need to exchange with the customer, especially on a pure battery car. And so that presents new opportunities to create new experiences for customers, so that\u2019s that incremental part where you can pick your routing on what is the best path for regenerative braking or you avoid the hills or it sets the mode of the car based on the terrain ahead of it. So there is a whole new set of car-relevant experiences that you want to create for that vehicle that is different than you have with an internal combustion engine.\nNow, because we\u2019re putting in place systems inside the vehicles that are far more capable than they have been in the past, to deliver these new capabilities that are relevant to driving a battery electric vehicle. So we\u2019re really working on finding those unique things. And with the Bolt, to explore a little bit, because of the nature of that vehicle and the nature of the people that are going to be buying that vehicle. Their latitude for technology and putting up with foibles of it are probably a little bit broader than somebody buying a Buick LaCrosse.\nI know Tesla\u2019s getting away with stuff that, you know, their customers are essentially beta testers for them in a lot of regards. And people love it! They know what they\u2019re being asked to go through, and the fact that they had 32 updates\u2026 I\u2019d be freaking, I know some people who would freak out that they had 32 updates. My God, why didn\u2019t they get it right upfront, what are they doing? And other people are like, cool, that\u2019s great, just keep on working at it. My windshield wipers didn\u2019t work the other day, now they do. Great! But we wouldn\u2019t have put the vehicle in the market if the wipers didn\u2019t work, and so, once again, the acceptance of these things change by those demographics and those markets. So what Mark was saying was we\u2019re going to have a little more latitude to try some things that maybe wouldn\u2019t be as accommodating to a broad customer base where we have to be a little more conservative in our approach.\n"
