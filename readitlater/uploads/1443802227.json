    "text": "Denizens of Elizabethan England dismissed a short-lived sensation as a \u201Cnine days\u2019 wonder.\u201D Andy Warhol spoke of fame lasting mere 15 minutes. These days, a reality-TV star would be lucky to light up the Twitterverse for that long.\nIf anyone has defied the fleeting nature of celebrity, however, it\u2019s Albert Einstein. He is arguably the greatest scientific icon in history, going by the strictly empirical measure of how often his likeness appears on coffee mugs and T-shirts, not to mention a conspicuous tendency among authors to cram his name into book titles hoping for stronger sales. Perhaps the longevity of his fame proves that the flow of time is relative, indeed.\nSixty years after his earthly demise, Einstein\u2019s stardom is primed for a grand revival yet again\u2014not that he has ever strayed far from the headlines, mind you, for much of his adult life and even from beyond the grave (though there is no actual grave in his case). The ostensible reason for the latest upswing in Einstein-mania is the centenary of his much-hyped theory of general relativity. Physicists around the globe are organizing week-long conferences and publishing hefty volumes to celebrate. You didn\u2019t expect street parties, did you?\nIt is a masterpiece worthy of hype and celebration, for sure. Equating gravity with geometry, the theory posited that a massive object, like the Sun, would warp the fabric of space-time around it. The hackneyed, and imprecise, analogy is of a bowling ball sagging the fabric of a trampoline. Stunning vindication came four years later, in 1919, when photographs of a solar eclipse, taken by intrepid English scientists who traveled to Brazil and to the African island of Principe, revealed a tiny deflection of starlight matching Einstein\u2019s prediction. The findings caused a media commotion, propelling Einstein\u2019s name into the stratosphere of fame. The legend of the superstar scientist was born.\nSince then, general relativity has survived every conceivable scientific test, as well as endless crackpot assaults, for a hundred years. That ain\u2019t no mean feat.\nThose who challenged the theory haven\u2019t fared so well. Take the case of the astronomer Thomas Jefferson Jackson See, a renowned telescopic observer and a charismatic public speaker (the naval captain\u2019s uniform adorning his six-foot-four figure didn\u2019t hurt). While much of the world toasted the eclipse result, See accused Einstein of plagiarism and worse. He denounced general relativity as \u201Ca crazy vagary, a disgrace to our age!\u201D The poor chap didn\u2019t seem to grasp what he was up against: Made a virtual pariah by the scientific community, he spent the rest of his quarrelsome life at a navy yard in California. Today See is remembered for little beside the controversies he wrought in his heyday, while public adulation of Einstein continues unabated. \u00A0\nGeneral relativity is not only elegant and successful as a theory. It is also surprisingly handy. Astronomers use it to \u201Cweigh\u201D the dark matter that dominates distant galaxy clusters and to discover alien planets through a technique known as \u201Cmicrolensing.\u201D\nAt this point, you might say: Sure, Einstein was one smart fellow, but what good has his highfalutin theory done for the rest of us? In fact, general relativity underpins a multibillion-dollar industry right here on planet Earth. And, you might want to thank the secular saint of science the next time your plane lands safely in bad weather.\nThat\u2019s because the global positioning system would not work properly without relativistic corrections: Internal clocks of GPS satellites would tick at different rates depending on their location in the Earth\u2019s gravitational field. If these offsets weren\u2019t accounted for, you might drive into a corner caf\u00E9, or worse, a pilot might miss the ground by miles. Perhaps Einstein wasn\u2019t that smart after all: Imagine the windfall his heirs would inherit had he found a way to patent this particular application of relativity.\nDespite the countless verifications of general relativity over the years, in the celestial realm and closer to home, scientists are not done with testing the theory yet. I, for one, am grateful for their insatiable, almost desperate, hankering to look for cracks in this grand edifice. It gave me a good excuse to do somersaults in zero gravity, on a parabolic flight operated by the European Space Agency, as a team of French physicists fine-tuned their apparatus (and a few unfortunate souls, with strained faces, were strapped in their seats, bravely resisting the overwhelming urge to puke). Their aim is to test whether rubidium and potassium atoms fall at exactly the same rate, as required by general relativity. The so-called equivalence principle has been tested already to a precision of one part in ten trillion. That may seem plenty good enough for most people, but most people are not scientists.\nMeanwhile, American physicists are now trying to test\u2014and exploit\u2014another critical prediction of general relativity. Using two identical facilities, nearly a continent apart, the Advanced Laser Interferometer Gravitational-wave Observatory (LIGO) is listening for rumbles generated by cataclysmic cosmic events. The experiment began collecting data in mid-September, after a 200-million-dollar overhaul that makes it much more sensitive than its predecessor, and the physics community is already buzzing with excitement. The direct detection of gravitational waves, which squish and stretch space itself, would not only bear out Einstein\u2014as if he really needs yet more vindication\u2014but also open up an entirely new way to explore the most violent bits of the universe.\nThus, a century after its conception, general relativity is on the verge of its most spectacular success. Chances are that its author Einstein, too, will continue to flout the ephemerality of fame for a while longer.\n\u201CThe changes to kindergarten make me sick,\u201D a veteran teacher in Arkansas recently admitted to me. \u201CThink about what you did in first grade\u2014that\u2019s what my 5-year-old babies are expected to do.\u201D \nThe difference between first grade and kindergarten may not seem like much, b ut what I remember about my first-grade experience in the mid-90s doesn\u2019t match the kindergarten she described in her email: three and a half hours of daily literacy instruction, an hour and a half of daily math instruction, 20 minutes of daily \u201Cphysical activity time\u201D (officially banned from being called \u201Crecess\u201D) and two 56-question standardized tests in literacy and math\u2014on the fourth week of school.\nThat American friend\u2014who teaches 20 students without an aide\u2014has fought to integrate 30 minutes of \u201Cstation time\u201D into the literacy block, which includes \u00A0\u201Cblocks, science, magnetic letters, play dough with letter stamps to practice words, books, and storytelling.\u201D But the most controversial area of her classroom isn\u2019t the blocks nor the stamps:  Rather, it\u2019s the  \u201Chouse station with dolls and toy food\u201D\u2014items her district tried to remove last year. The implication was clear: There\u2019s no time for play in kindergarten anymore. \nWe can now add another one to that list: Old Economy Steve ate at McDonald\u2019s almost every day, and he still somehow had a 32-inch waist.\nThis week, lawyers for Liberty Counsel and representatives from the Vatican confirmed that Pope Francis met with Kim Davis, the clerk of Rowan County, Kentucky, who has refused to perform same-sex marriages. It immediately became one of the biggest stories about the pope\u2019s trip to the United States: A pontiff who has strained to change the Church\u2019s tone on issues from abortion to homosexuality met with one of the most divisive figures in American politics.\nWhen Joss Whedon\u2019s classic show Buffy the Vampire Slayer went off the air in 2003, its cult status was still very much nascent. Cue the novels, comics, video games, and spinoffs, not to mention fan sites, fan fiction, conventions, and inclusion on scores of \u201CBest TV Shows of All Time\u201D lists. But while it remains good fun to watch a seemingly ditzy teenager and her friends fight the forces of darkness with super-strength, magic, and witty banter, the show\u2019s seven seasons have also become the subject of critical inquiry from a more intellectually rigorous fanbase: academics.\nBuffy, along with critically acclaimed series like The X-Files and Twin Peaks, came before The Sopranos and the beginning of the Golden Age of Television, but helped pave the way for scholars to treat television shows like The Wire, Mad Men, and Breaking Bad as sprawling works of art to be dissected and analyzed alongside the greatest works of literature. Academics have found Whedon\u2019s cult classic to be particularly multi-dimensional\u2014trading heavily on allegory, myth, and cultural references\u2014while combining an inventive narrative structure with dynamic characters and social commentary.\nOne night in July\u2014the night before her first day of work\u2014a new doctor picked at a container of sushi in her apartment on a sleepy street in Brooklyn. She tried to swallow a few bites as she chatted on the phone with her best friend from medical school, who was also marking the eve of his first day as a working physician. \u201CBreak a leg,\u201D she said. \u201CBut not really.\u201D\nThere wasn\u2019t any street noise to keep her up as she tried to go to sleep early for her 5:00 a.m. start\u2014but even in the silence, heavy with midsummer humidity, she couldn\u2019t drift off. For two months, since she\u2019d graduated medical school, her body had registered her mounting stress leading up to her first day in the hospital. She was plagued by insomnia. Food made her nauseated, except plain donuts, which she ordered twice a day from the diner at the end of her block. She\u2019d eat them while studying diagnoses and procedures that she\u2019d learned in school and long since forgotten, crumbs piling up in the crease of her textbook. In the months between graduating and starting work, she lost more than 15 pounds.\nSomething strange is happening at America\u2019s colleges and universities. A movement is arising, undirected and driven largely by students, to scrub campuses clean of words, ideas, and subjects that might cause discomfort or give offense. Last December, Jeannie Suk wrote in an online article for The New Yorker about law students asking her fellow professors at Harvard not to teach rape law\u2014or, in one case, even use the word violate (as in \u201Cthat violates the law\u201D) lest it cause students distress. In February, Laura Kipnis, a professor at Northwestern University, wrote an essay in The Chronicle of Higher Education describing a new campus politics of sexual paranoia\u2014and was then subjected to a long investigation after students who were offended by the article and by a tweet she\u2019d sent filed Title IX complaints against her. In June, a professor protecting himself with a pseudonym wrote an essay for Vox describing how gingerly he now has to teach. \u201CI\u2019m a Liberal Professor, and My Liberal Students Terrify Me,\u201D the headline said. A number of popular comedians, including Chris Rock, have stopped performing on college campuses (see Caitlin Flanagan\u2019s article in this month\u2019s issue). Jerry Seinfeld and Bill Maher have publicly condemned the oversensitivity of college students, saying too many of them can\u2019t take a joke.\n"
