    "text": "Over the past few days, you may have seen reports that the iPhone 6s and 6s Plus are waterproof. In fact, not just reports; there now exist multiple videos that show Apple\u2019s new smartphones surviving extended periods of water submersion. Those videos aren\u2019t fabrications or pranks. Apple\u2019s new iPhones really do hold up under water, thanks to a brilliant new technique that the company quietly pioneered.\nThat\u2019s not to say that you should go tossing your $650+ smartphone in the toilet on purpose. As with all smartphones claiming impermeability, the new iPhones are water-resistant, not fully waterproof. If you do slip, though, you\u2019ve got a better shot at survival than any previous generation of iPhone has offered. And the best part about Apple\u2019s ingenious water-safe solution? It doesn\u2019t affect the phone\u2019s appearance, performance, or repairability in any significant way.\nWater resistance itself isn\u2019t a novel smartphone trait; Motorola was touting the submersibility of the Defy+ as long ago as 2011. Rightly so; water\u2019s a killer.\n\u201CTypically, if you get a phone wet, the danger comes when you have logic board contacts with a charge running through them exposed to water,\u201D explains Jeff Suovanen, an engineer at iFixit who recently took an iPhone 6s apart to study its water-resistant credentials. \u201CThey can short out, and afterwards they can start to corrode.\u201D Once that happens, bye-bye phone.\nConventional wisdom leans on the brute-force method of coating a device\u2019s case to keep the water out. \u201CThat\u2019s what we were looking for,\u201D says Suovanen. \u201CWe started looking at the case, the headphone jack, the Lightning port, to see if they did anything to keep water out.\u201D Aside from a thin adhesive strip, though, nothing about the iPhone 6s exterior stood out as substantively different from the iPhone 6.\nInside, though, was another story. Suovanen quickly found that rather than waterproof the case, Apple had opted to waterproof the logic board itself.\n\u201CIt\u2019s basically a thin wall, it almost looks like wetsuit material. It\u2019s not that, but it looks like that. It\u2019s soft, spongy, you can press on it and feel it give a little bit,\u201D Suovanen says. \u201CIt\u2019s surrounding those little logic board connectors, and then the ribbon cable connects over the top and creates a little pressure seal to keep the water out.\u201D\nThat may sound familiar to Apple patent obsessives; the company filed one for this very technology in March of 2014. In terms of elegance, it\u2019s the difference between trying to throw a tarp over a crowded sidewalk and handing everyone an umbrella.\n\u201CSome of the other waterproof phones work really well, but this is more straightforward,\u201D explains Suovanen. \u201CTrying to waterproof a case, where you have to leave openings for ports and headphone jacks and things like that, is probably a more difficult way to do it.\u201D Apple\u2019s innovation amounts to introducing tactical strikes to a world that\u2019s only ever known cluster bombing.\nIt\u2019s natural to wonder what compromises Apple made to fit this new system under an already crowded hood, especially given that the iPhone 6s has a smaller battery than its immediate predecessor. Don\u2019t blame the silicon seals, though, says Suovanen.\n\u201CThe battery capacity is down slightly, but I suspect that has more to do with implementing the 3D Touch technology they came out with,\u201D the teardown specialist explains. \u201CThis year\u2019s Taptic Engine is a bigger, thicker vibrator than the iPhone had last year, so they may not have had quite as much room left for the battery.\u201D If a downside to the new seals does exist, no one\u2019s spotted it yet.\nIt might seem odd, then, that Apple hasn\u2019t trumpeted this water-resistance; surely its ability to survive a puddle dunking would have fit somewhere on the company\u2019s marketing materials, or at least somewhere in its on-stage detailing of the devices last month. Outside of better battery life, there\u2019s maybe no more sought-after smartphone trait than simple resilience.\nOr so one might think. The phones that have offered this level of water resistance, though, haven\u2019t exactly been chart-toppers. The Samsung Galaxy S6 Active; the Sony Xperia Z3; the HTC Desire Eye; these are phones (or variants) you may have heard of, but their aquaphobia hasn\u2019t demonstrably made them any more desirable. Besides which, the new iPhones aren\u2019t necessarily more water-resistant than others, at least not in any way that\u2019s easily perceivable to consumers; they\u2019re just water-resistant in a more clever way.\nEven if it\u2019s largely invisible to its customers, that cleverness could pay off soon for Apple. \u201CNow that you can pay a small monthly fee and get a new iPhone every year, Apple\u2019s going to be getting a lot of iPhones back,\u201D says Suovanen of the company\u2019s new iPhone Upgrade Plan. \u201CIn the long run this may help them save money. Because the iPhones are less susceptible to water damage, they\u2019re getting them back in better condition.\u201D\nThat helps explain, too, Apple opting not to coat the case itself. The same features that make a waterproof case effective make it hell to take apart or repair. \u201CWe find a lot of times with waterproof devices that getting in and out is much more difficult,\u201D says Suovanen. \u201CThey seal them together often times with glue, and adhesives, and things that are difficult to take apart without destroying them.\u201D That\u2019s not ideal under any circumstances, but especially not if Apple wants to leave open the possibility of reintroducing all those trade-ins to the secondary market.\nAgain, the new iPhone isn\u2019t invincible. If you soak it long enough, you will break it. It will, though, get through accidental drops and drips better than any iPhone before it, and at least as well as almost any other waterproof smartphone out there. Not bad for a feature that didn\u2019t even make the spec sheet.\n"
