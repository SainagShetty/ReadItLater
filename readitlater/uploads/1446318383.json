This can come in handy for username fields. Do so by implementing code along the following lines:\nNone of the above works. I tried setting autocomplete=off, I tried setting the meta tag to no cache, I tried programatically setting the values with jquery and I tried to explicitly setting the value to nothing. Why is nothing possible when we need this simple functionality? It is a time thief that html, css and javascript are so lousy tools they can\u2019t even make the simple things simple. This is a simple task so it should be simple and there should be one obvious solution so where is the obvious solution?\nThis basically makes it so that the field is locked until you click in there. This worked every time for me without having any of the other workarounds in place (of which I had tried them all, even salting the url string and autocomplete fields with random numbers!)\n"
