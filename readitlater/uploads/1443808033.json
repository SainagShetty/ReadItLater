Sure, the location usually made sense\u2014someplace defensible, on a hill or an island, or somewhere near an extractable resource or the confluence of two transport routes. But what happened next was ad hoc. The people who worked in the fort or the mines or the port or the warehouses needed places to eat, to sleep, to worship. Infrastructure threaded through the hustle and bustle\u2014water, sewage, roads, trolleys, gas, electricity\u2014in vast networks of improvisation. You can find planned exceptions: Alexandria, Roman colonial towns, certain districts in major Chinese cities, Haussmann\u2019s Paris. But for the most part it was happenstance, luck, and layering the new on top of the old.\n \t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\tSubscribe to WIRED\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t\n \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n \t\t At least, that\u2019s the way things worked for most of human history. But around the second decade of the 20th century, things changed. Cities started to happen on purpose. Beginning with New York City\u2019s zoning laws in 1916, development began to occur by commission, not omission. Laws and regulations dictated the shape of the envelope. Functional decisions determined aesthetic outcomes\u2014not always for the best.\n So let\u2019s jump to now: A century, plus or minus, after human beings started putting their minds toward designing cities as a whole, things are getting good. High tech materials, sensor networks, new science, and better data are all letting architects, designers, and planners work smarter and more precisely. Cities are getting more environmentally sound, more fun, and more beautiful. And just in time, because today more human beings live in cities than not.\n In this year\u2019s design issue, we\u2019re telling the stories of some of those projects, from the detail of a new streetlight to a sacred city in flux, from masterful museums to infrastructure made for bikes (and the algorithms that run it all). The cities of tomorrow might still self-assemble haltingly, but done right, the process won\u2019t be accidental. A city shouldn\u2019t just happen anymore. Every block, every building, every brick represents innumerable decisions. Decide well, and cities are magic. \u2014Adam Rogers\n \t\t \t\n   \t\t\t\t\t \t\t \t\n  \t\tSCROLL DOWN \t\n    \t\t\t\t\t  \t\t \t\t\t\nClick to share this story on Twitter \n\n\n  \t\t\t\nClick to share this story on Facebook \n\n\n  \t\t\t\nhttp://www.wired.com/2015/09/design-issue-future-of-cities/#la\n\n\n\nCopied\n \n \n  \n  \t\t\tLit by LEDs: Most lamps have about 10 to 20 diodes.\n \n \n \n  \n  Lit by sodium-vapor lights\n \n \n \n\n \n \t\t \t\n   \t\t\t\t\t  \t\t \t\t\t\nClick to share this story on Twitter \n\n\n  \t\t\t\nClick to share this story on Facebook \n\n\n  \t\t\t\nhttp://www.wired.com/2015/09/design-issue-future-of-cities/#la\n\n\n\nCopied\n \n \n \t\t \t\n   \t\t\t\t\tLA Goes LED\u2014and Gets Connected\n Los Angeles is retrofitting 4,500 miles of orange-yellow sodium-vapor streetlights with a moonlight-hued matrix of light-emitting diodes. Roads will look brighter, but they\u2019ll also be more connected. Every energy-efficient lamp will link wirelessly to the Bureau of Street Lighting, letting headquarters know if it is on, off, broken, etc. And in the future? Lights that change in response to what\u2019s going on around them. They might blink if a police car or ambulance is on its way or brighten for pedestrians after a ball game. While other cities around the world use LEDs to save money and add splashes of color and emphasis, LA plans to build a network that does more than show what\u2019s happening right in front of you. It tells you something about the entire city. \u2014Adam Rogers\n \nAn Airport in the Airport for Celebs and Other Elite Fliers\n The swanky and exclusive Delta One lounge in LAX\u2019s Terminal 5.   Courtesy of DELTA More than 70 million people passed through Los Angeles International Airport in 2014\u2014a jet-lagged gauntlet of wheely bags and neck pillows. Now LAX is getting an upgrade, a more than $8 billion overhaul of everything from concession areas to moving walkways. Delta kicked in $229 million to rework its Terminal 5. The revamp includes Delta One, a sort of airport within the airport that caters to celebrities and the wealthy. It presages a future where airports are less ad hoc, better organized, and not so dehumanizing.\n On arrival, a curbside attendant checks your name, velvet-rope-style. Once you\u2019re checked in, it\u2019s off to a swanky lounge, one of the most private spaces in the terminal. When it\u2019s time to board, Delta escorts take you up a private elevator and down a private corridor to the front of the line at a priority security checkpoint.\n On the way home you can opt for an express exit with Delta\u2019s VIP Select service. You\u2019re chaperoned to the tarmac, then a hybrid Porsche zooms you across the airfield and onto Century Boulevard where, presumably, your driver will be waiting. \u2014Nate Berg\n \nTo Beat the Drought, LA Turns to Less-Thirsty Landscapes\n The palm trees along Hollywood Boulevard may be iconic, but native to LA they are not.

Actors and dancers with wireless mics will perform on the sidewalk and in cars passing by, mixing with the ballet of everyday city life.\n \u201CLA feels like the central character,\u201D says Yuval Sharon, artistic director of the Industry, the opera company behind the production. Audience members\u2014just 96 per performance\u2014will also leave the cars and enter buildings and public spaces, with each walk or ride telling one of 36 chapters.

Then there\u2019s the new Shanghai Natural History Museum. Set in a park near the Pudong financial district, the building spirals down, into the earth, like an excavation of the city\u2019s pre-urban roots. A central courtyard (shown above) inspired by the water gardens of Suzhou is a reminder of the value that ancient Chinese culture placed on natural beauty. Around it, a honeycombed glass wall, evoking the cell structure of plants, fills the interior with sunlight.\n Architect Ralph Johnson of Perkins+Will says the shape of the building was inspired by the nautilus shell, but it\u2019s also for traffic control: Chinese museums are often thronged, and the descending ramps steer crowds through a chronological tour of life on Earth. On the way, they encounter some 11,000 specimens\u2014including a towering Mamenchi\u00ADsaurus skeleton and later fauna that once thrived in Shanghai\u2019s vanishing wetlands. There\u2019s plenty of forward-looking tech too\u2014like green climate and water systems. (That courtyard pool helps cool the building.)

During the \u201990s, drug gangs and guerrilla fighters controlled the narrow streets. As the violence waned and people started venturing out, they came up against another challenge: It was really hard to get anywhere.\n To knit together the fractured city, then-mayor Luis P\u00E9rez proposed a novel solution: cable cars. Rather than having to pick their way down perilous hillsides, people could hop in a gondola and soar to a metro station. The first Metrocable line opened in 2004 and was quickly followed by others.\n \u201CThe genius of the Metrocable is that it actually serves the poor and integrates them into the city, gives them access to jobs and other opportunities,\u201D says Julio D\u00E1vila, a Colombian urban planner at University College London. \u201CNobody had ever done that before.\u201D As people of all classes started using the cars to visit \u201Cbad\u201D neighborhoods, they became invested in their city\u2019s fate, heralding a decade of some of the world\u2019s most innovative urban planning. \u2014Lizzie Wade\n \nCombining Libraries and Parks into Safe Spaces for All\n Interior of Medell\u00EDn\u2019s Biblioteca Espana, designed by architect Giancarlo Mazzanti.

As the city\u2019s director of urban projects from 2004 to 2008, the architect threw himself into tackling some of Medell\u00EDn\u2019s most challenging urban problems. His secret weapon? Beautiful design. But his efforts weren\u2019t aimed at the rich\u2014Echeverri insisted on working in the same low-income areas the cable cars had opened up. \u201CA good building, a well-designed space, a dignified public transit system, a quality cultural event\u2014these all work on a psychological level to generate a feeling that you are included in the city,\u201D he says. That philosophy guided the design of five libraries sprinkled throughout Medell\u00EDn, all surrounded by beautiful greenery. These \u201Clibrary-parks\u201D were among the first safe public spaces many neighborhoods had ever seen. (After Echeverri\u2019s tenure as director ended, the city built five more.)\n But Echeverri knew he couldn\u2019t just throw up nice buildings and expect life to improve. His department went street by street, planting trees and replacing crumbling schools. \u201COne of the keys to Medell\u00EDn\u2019s success is that these aren\u2019t isolated projects,\u201D Echeverri says. They\u2019re all woven together\u2014cocreations, as he calls them\u2014with the communities that use them every day. \u2014Lizzie Wade\n \t\t \t\n  \t\t\t\n\n\n\t\t\n   \t\t\t\t\t  \n  \n \n \nCommunity Activists Fight Back With Graffiti\n Activist graffiti on the streets of Medell\u00EDn.   Perrograff Spray paint in hand, Daniel Felipe Quiceno, aka Perrograff, aims at the wall. \u201CThe lines of your signature need to be well defined,\u201D he tells the group gathered around him for a lesson in graffiti. With a practiced flourish, he creates a sharp swoop of blue. Then he hands out aerosol cans so his students can try making their own mark on Medell\u00EDn.\n Since Perrograff started the Graffitour three years ago, it has brought hundreds of visitors to the once-neglected streets of Comuna 13. That\u2019s where he grew up, amid terrible violence. To fight back, his cohort began transforming run-down corners of their town by covering them in murals that illustrate Comuna 13\u2019s history and that memorialize murdered friends; they also started planting community gardens.\n Grassroots efforts like the Graffitour have been a vital part of Medell\u00EDn\u2019s transformation, says Jota Samper, an urban planner who grew up there and now teaches at MIT. The Metrocable and library-parks are great, but \u201Cwhat makes these projects amazing are the neighborhoods where they are located,\u201D he says. For his part, Perrograff hopes his community work will soon go beyond two dimensions. After years of painting flat surfaces, he\u2019s studying to be an architect. \u2014Lizzie Wade\n \t\t \t\n   \t\t\t\t\t \t\t \t\n  \t\tSCROLL DOWN \t\n    \t\t\t\t\t  \t\t \t\t\t\nClick to share this story on Twitter \n\n\n  \t\t\t\nClick to share this story on Facebook \n\n\n  \t\t\t\nhttp://www.wired.com/2015/09/design-issue-future-of-cities/#eindhoven\n\n\n\nCopied\n \n \n    \n \n \n The Challenge\n Separate bikes and cars at this busy intersection\u2014and do it in a style befitting the entryway to one of Europe\u2019s most innovative cities.\n   \n  Click circles for more.\n \n \n \n \n  \n  DECISION: THINK SMALL To keep the ring small and maximize visibility for motorists, the designers opted for a floating deck suspended from a central pylon.\n \n \n \n  \n  DECISION: KEEP IT CLEAN Running cables to the outer edge would have cluttered the look and crowded users.

That\u2019s when Muslims visit Mecca for one of the religion\u2019s most sacred rites: the hajj. Most cities aren\u2019t built with that kind of surge capacity. And as the tragic stampede at this year\u2019s gathering showed, at a certain density those crowds can become dangerous. So the Saudis have, over the years, turned to a series of the world\u2019s best architects and designers to try to keep millions of pilgrims safe, healthy, awed, and (a few of them) very, very comfortable\u2014while honoring the tenets of Islam. The result is a city of carefully regulated experiences, with more work yet to be done. \u2014Tim De Chant\n \nA Purpose-Built Airport for a Massive Wave of Visitors\n  The Hajj Terminal at King Abdulaziz International Airport.   Bryan Christie Design Inspired by traditional Bedouin tents, the 2.8-million-square-foot Hajj Terminal at King Abdulaziz International Airport has two massive cable-stayed, Teflon-coated fiberglass roofs. Passengers grab their luggage in the climate-controlled section; natural ventilation in the open-air waiting area keeps temperatures around 80 degrees Fahrenheit, even while they hit a searing 120 outside. There pilgrims wait\u2014sometimes up to 36 hours\u2014for their ride to Mecca, 43 miles to the east. \u2014Tim De Chant\n \nDisappear 600 Tons of Trash a Day With Pneumatic Tubes\n   The $20 billion-plus the Saudi government has spent on mosque improvements will solve at least one unholy problem: 600 tons of trash a day. It\u2019ll disappear into 400 openings and get sucked at 40 mph through an underground network of pneumatic tubes to a station more than a mile away, where trucks will take it to a landfill. \u2014Juliette Spertus\n \n  \n\n \n \nExpanding the Great Mosque to Handle Bigger Crowds\n  The second-tallest building in the world, the Abraj Al-Bait hotel.  Bryan Christie Design The Masjid al-Haram, the Great Mosque of Mecca, is an ever-expanding house of worship built around the holiest shrine in all of Islam\u2014the cloth-draped granite cube known as the Kaaba. Pilgrims walk seven times counterclockwise around the Kaaba twice on their hajj trip, and in recent years crowds have been so thick that they\u2019ve forced people onto the mosque\u2019s roof. Architects from the firm Gensler took a cue from those rooftop pilgrims and proposed a series of eight-sided platforms surrounding the Kaaba. Upgrading the mosque has been a delicate balancing act, says Bill Hooper, head of Gensler\u2019s transportation practice. \u201CWe needed to keep them as close in to the Kaaba as we could but not compromise the emotional experience.\u201D The solution, Hooper says, will improve traffic flow, double capacity, and maintain sight lines. Buildings around the Masjid al-Haram have been received less fondly, though. Abraj Al-Bait is the least-likely second-tallest building in the world, dominated by a Big Ben-like central clock tower that looms 1,972 feet above the mosque.

For decades the sandy plain was crammed with simple cotton tents, but a deadly fire in 1997 sent the Saudi government searching for a durable fireproof replacement. Now an extensive network of permanent hydrants helps protect more than 100,000 air-conditioned, semipermanent structures of Teflon-coated fiberglass, each ranging from 250 to 850 square feet. And since close quarters can also aid the spread of illness, Mina has dedicated hospitals and ambulances too. Safety is still an issue here, though\u2014it was in Mina that a stampede killed at least 700 people during this year\u2019s Hajj. \u2014Tim De Chant\n The 100,000-tent city (upper half) and the five-level Jamarat Bridge (bottom).   Bryan Christie Design Adding Levels to a Bridge Where Pilgrims Throw Stones at the Devil\n Pilgrims come to the Jamarat Bridge on the third day of the hajj for the Stoning of the Devil\u2014to throw seven pebbles at each of the three jamarat, pillars representing the three times Abraham refused the devil\u2019s challenges. The bridge was the site of several stampedes in the \u201900s, one of the most dangerous parts of the crowded pilgrimage, before architects built the area around the jamarat into a long five-level bridge. Now people have better access to the pillars, and a handful of exit ramps can now help quickly clear the structure, though the area still gets crammed with people. \u2014Tim De Chant\n \n  \n  \n \n \t\t \t\n   \t\t\t\t\t \t\t \t\n  \t\tSCROLL DOWN \t\n    \t\t\t\t\t  \t\t \t\t\t\nClick to share this story on Twitter \n\n\n  \t\t\t\nClick to share this story on Facebook \n\n\n  \t\t\t\nhttp://www.wired.com/2015/09/design-issue-future-of-cities/#nairobi\n\n\n\nCopied\n \n \n \t\t \t\n     \t\t\t\t\tTaming a Chaotic Minibus Network With an Orderly Map\n Most people get around Nairobi in minibuses. Run by various entrepreneurs, the vehicles\u2014called matatus\u2014are cheap, plentiful, and known for loud music and sparkly disco balls. But schedules in this ad hoc network change at will, and finding the right route or stop is a crapshoot\u2014a wrong decision can add hours to your trip.\n Enter a group of researchers and designers called Digital Matatus. It tasked local university students with riding the buses and using a smartphone app to track the routes and stops. When Digital Matatus released its subway-style map of more than 100 routes and major stops last year, people snatched them up. \u201CWomen, especially, said, \u2018This is valuable, because at night I don\u2019t want to get on the wrong matatu where I don\u2019t feel safe,\u2019\u201D says Jacqueline Klopp, one of the project leads.\n But it gets even cooler: A few months ago, the Nairobi matatus became the first informal transit system on Google Maps. The move to a global platform legitimizes the zippy little vehicles and shows other cities how they too might harness these networks. Ultimately the goal is to strengthen the matatu system even further\u2014fingers crossed it will still include a disco ball or two. \u2014Shara Tonn\n \n THE CHALLENGE: Provide riders of Nairobi\u2019s ad hoc minibus system with a useful map. DECISION 1: Deploy students with GPS-enabled smartphones to map it. DECISION 2: Because people often navigate a city via landmarks, the team built the map around familiar locations rather than numeric addresses.

The only way to get off the then-six-lane highway and onto intersecting roads was a congested roundabout that required drivers to stop before merging into traffic. Finally, in 2006, city officials decided to restructure parts of the highway, starting with the dreaded roundabout. \u00B6 Rather than use a cloverleaf\u2014the century-old grandfather of congestion remedies\u2014they opted for a more modern configuration known as a turbine interchange. Devised in the UK in the 1960s, it allows drivers coming from four directions to engage in any turn or change of direction without slowing or weaving into traffic. Unlike stacked interchanges, which can involve four, five, or even six tiers of elevated highways, turbines require fewer levels, so the overall materials cost is much lower. \u201CThe turbine is high-speed and high-capacity,\u201D says Gilbert Chlewicki, director of Advanced Transportation Solutions, a civil-engineering consultancy. \u201CIt\u2019s the most efficient and practical solution.\u201D\n \t\t \t\n  \t\t\t\n\n\n\t\t\n   \t\t\t\t\tTurbines use up a lot of land, but that\u2019s not a problem in sprawling Dubai. So after two years and $111 million, the Arabian Ranches Interchange opened in 2008, connecting Emirates Road (now known as Sheikh Mohammed Bin Zayed Road) with the Umm Suqeim and Al Qudra roads. The turbine is nearly a third of a mile wide, with 11 bridges extending a total of 1.5 miles. That sounds like a tangle, but rotational symmetry makes for a consistent driving experience from all four approaches. And in a nation that seems to pride itself on ornate displays of wealth, the simplicity isn\u2019t so hard on the eyes, either. \u2014Ian Frisch\n LA: Spencer Lowell; Shanghai: Courtesy of Perkins+Will / James and Connor Steinkamp Photography; Medell\u00EDn: Corbis; Eindhoven: Courtesy of IPV Delft; Nairobi: Andrea Kuenzig / LAIF / Redux; Dubai: Digitalglobe Inc.; Diagrams: Brown Bird Design\n \n  \t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\n \t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\n \t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\n \t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\n \t\t\n\n \t\t\n \t\n  \t             \t                         \n\n\n\n"
