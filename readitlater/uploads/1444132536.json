    "text": "Indian and Pakistan might be quarreling on several issues, from Kashmir to cross-border terrorism, but the view from above, far above, is quite different.\u00A0Yes, things might look grim on the ground, but from space, it's a different story.\nNasa\u00A0has released a photo taken by an\u00A0astronaut aboard the International Space Station which captures the India-Pakistan border in the nighttime. The photograph manages to include Karachi, visible as a cluster of lights facing a completely black Arabian Sea, the Indus Valley, the foothills of Himalayas and the winding border between Indian\u00A0and Pakistan, lit by security lights that have a distinct \"orange tone\", all in one frame.\nDespite all the bitterness and violence that plagues the border areas, the photograph evokes a sense of serenity and peace.\nThe photo was taken\u00A0on\u00A0\u00A023 September, 2015 and has been made public by Nasa's Earth Observatory website.\nAccording to the website, the picture was taken using a Nikon D4 digital camera, fitted with a 28 millimetre lens, and was provided by the ISS Crew Earth Observations Facility and the Earth Science and Remote Sensing Unit, Johnson Space Center. The image was taken by a member of the Expedition 45 crew, the website adds.\n"
