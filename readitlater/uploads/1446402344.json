    "text": "On July 6, Bill McDermott, the chief executive of one of the world\u2019s largest software companies, fell down the stairs at his brother\u2019s house. He awoke in a pool of blood.\nMr. McDermott was holding a drinking glass when he fell, and it shattered and entered his face, leaving a vertical scar from above his left eye to below his ear. The glass also entered his left eye, causing him to lose the organ after unsuccessfully undergoing several surgeries and procedures to keep it.\nThe experience is spurring Mr. McDermott, 54, to move his company, SAP \u2014 a firm based in Germany that specializes in large-scale software for manufacturers, retailers and the like \u2014 deeper into health care. When Mr. McDermott returned to work in early October, his first public act was to talk about how SAP should be working to make health care better by focusing on more cross-disciplinary work, digitized information that can easily be shared and analyzed, and, yes, big data.\n\u201CDoctors in my case were sending each other dictation to each other\u2019s cell phones,\u201D Mr. McDermott said in his first interview since the accident, the scars of his wound still visible under dark glasses. \u201CThere were digital files of M.R.I.s, data from my surgery in the trauma unit and scans from the emergency response team that never went into the case file.\u201D\nWhether his eye could have been saved with a more networked cloud-computing system, where digital files could be easily stored and shared, Mr. McDermott didn\u2019t know. But he said the process could be better. \u201CThe first responders, the doctors and the nurses were all wonderful, but they are too pressed,\u201D he said. \u201CThe retina guy couldn\u2019t talk with the cornea guy.\u201D\nIt may be easy to pass off Mr. McDermott\u2019s newfound enthusiasm for incorporating more SAP-type products into health care as opportunistic. But that misses an element of tech company leadership: When top tech executives and founders face personal health traumas, they often turn to their industry to fix things.\nThe examples are legion. Andy Grove, a legendary leader at Intel in the 1980s and 1990s, was diagnosed with Parkinson\u2019s disease in 2000. Soon after, he began working with the Michael J. Fox Foundation, bringing together Intel and the Parkinson\u2019s group for patient monitoring and analysis.\nPaul Allen, a co-founder of Microsoft who left the company in 1983 to successfully battle Hodgkin\u2019s disease and who was later diagnosed with lymphoma, is spending billions on a better understanding of the human cell. Sergey Brin, Google\u2019s co-founder who carries a gene that may cause Parkinson\u2019s, has given millions of dollars for a better understanding of the disease and its treatment.\nEric Dishman, the head of Intel\u2019s health and life sciences group, battled cancer in his kidneys for 23 years, experiencing 72 different and incorrect diagnoses. Five years ago, he was on his last business trip before needing daily dialysis, when a start-up offered to sequence his genome. It took three months using Intel\u2019s high-performance machines, but doctors eventually deciphered unique aspects of his treatment.\n\u201CI came back and said, \u2018We have to give precision health to everyone,\u2019\u201D Mr. Dishman said. \u201CThere are too many health care executives who haven\u2019t been through these things.\u201D\nIntel now has a goal of getting genome-sequencing time down to one day by 2020, and wants research institutions to share more data.\n\u201CYou see this in the way people are passionate about the quantified self,\u201D or better health through body sensors and computation, said Paul Saffo, a Silicon Valley historian at Stanford University. \u201CThe tech titans aren\u2019t getting any younger, so they are thinking about mortality.\u201D\nThey are also thinking about extending life. Google, now called Alphabet, has funded Calico, a life sciences company, which is charged with using advanced technology to control the human lifespan. And the X Prize Foundation \u2014 a Mountain View, Calif., nonprofit that is popular with techies \u2014 sponsors, through the semiconductor maker Qualcomm, a $10 million prize for whoever builds a body-analyzing machine like the tricorder from \u201CStar Trek.\u201D \u201CBring healthcare to the palm of your hand,\u201D it says on the X Prize website.\n\u201COn Wall Street, you throw money at a problem,\u201D Mr. Saffo said. \u201COut here, the attitude of people is that problems can be fixed with tech. Right now, instead of research and development, there\u2019s a sense of \u2018search and redevelopment.\u2019 There are answers out there in the data. Things just have to be done differently.\u201D\nFew areas seem as ripe for tech-based reworking as the kind of siloed care Mr. McDermott experienced.\n\u201CWe imagine creating better oncology care using data from more diverse groups of patients,\u201D said David Delaney, a doctor who works with SAP\u2019s health care industries group. \u201CGiven Bill\u2019s experience, we\u2019re figuring out where to go in the better coordination of people and processes.\u201D\nSAP currently sells a range of software to the health care industry, including patient billing and research tools. For the past several years, it has been moving from software that resides in on-site computers to cloud-based systems with more networking and big-data analysis that hospitals can access remotely.\nMr. McDermott, who hails from a working class family in Long Island, New York, says his weeks fighting to keep his eye have ultimately put him in a good place.\n\u201CI\u2019ve always felt like the luckiest guy in the world,\u201D he said. \u201CNow I feel like I\u2019m on a mission. There are a lot of institutional problems in the system.\u201D\n"
