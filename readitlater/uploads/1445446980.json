    "text": "Tesla\u2019s Model S sedan has got an update to its software that lets it automatically steer, switch lanes, parallel park, and help keep you from crashing. And from the looks of things, it seems to work pretty darn well.\nThe latest version doesn\u2019t make the Model S an entirely autonomous vehicle, but it does take most of the stress out of getting through traffic, as Jalopnik found while testing the car\u2019s Autonomous Level 2 system in New York City traffic.\nThe instrument cluster turns into a visualization of the road ahead and the car uses a radar, camera and ultrasonic sensors to keep you moving safely towards your destination without any untoward incidents. However, you\u2019ll still need to manually make navigational turns and can\u2019t interpret\u00A0traffic signs.\nJalopnik notes that while the Model S isn\u2019t yet a 100% self-driving vehicle, the new software update brings a near-perfect cruise control mode \u2014 and for commuters, that\u2019s a godsend.\n"
