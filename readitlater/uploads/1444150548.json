    "text": "Do you want to be more successful? Many successful entrepreneurs share similar ideals and routines which play an intrinsic part in their success.\nHere we look at 8 routines and beliefs successful entrepreneurs use every day.\n\u00A01. They Have A Morning Routine\nAuthor Laura Vanderkam extensively studied the schedules of various high achievers. She found one thing that they had in common; they got up early, and almost all of them also had a morning routine.\nRichard Branson is also an advocate of embracing the morning.\nGetting up early has lots of benefits. You get the chance to be available and present before demands are made of you, and before you need to start working on your goals. This can improve your mood, as you feel in control of your life.\nGetting up and completing your morning routine will help you to feel confident and in control, ready to handle the challenges that the day throws at you.\nHow To Adjust Your Schedule: Consider scheduling tasks you would normally do in the evening in the morning instead. For instance, try exercising before you go to work to help you feel revitalized and productive.\n2. They Don\u2019t Panic When Things Go Slightly Wrong\nMany people start to feel stressed and anxious when things don\u2019t go exactly to plan, but these things can happen on a daily basis. Successful people realize they cannot control everything, and anticipate mistakes.\nDealing with problems is a big part of being a successful entrepreneur. Plan for mistakes, and you will deal with them rationally and efficiently as they arise.\nHow To Adjust Your Schedule: Factor In time every day to help you deal with any problems that arise. Half an hour at the end of your working day is ideal, as it means you can focus on the tasks you want to complete during the day.\n3. They Work When They Don\u2019t Have To\nFirst thing in the morning, the evenings and the weekend are all times that most people are not working. However, you could be wasting your productivity. Many successful entrepreneurs will work whenever inspiration strikes, as they know they will be more productive then than later.\nIf you have a great pitch for work, strike while the iron is hot and get working \u2013 even if you\u2019re not in work.\nHow To Adjust Your Schedule: Plan two hours work you will do during your free time, from replying to emails to making important calls. This will help you to get ahead and stay ahead.\n4. They Do Important Work First\nMany people arrive at the office and start their day with the little tasks, like emailing and admin. However, our brains are sharpest earlier in the day, so this is the best time to tackle the more creative work that challenges you.\nIf you don\u2019t get the opportunity to work on your chosen tasks first thing, take matters into your own hands; do the work from home, or come into work early.\nHow To Adjust Your Schedule: Set your schedule for the next day while you are still at work. Plan your most important tasks for first thing in the morning, and then respond to your emails before lunch to guarantee a productive day.\n\u00A05. They Keep Their Full Schedules In One Place\n\u201CIt\u2019s crucial to make sure you record all your meetings and appointments in one place instead of having them scattered throughout different calendars, notebooks, and apps,\u201D says Alexandra Weiss, a partner at CA Creative in New York.\nInstead of planning parts of your schedule on your phone, laptop, work computer and notepad, gather everything together on one device. It won\u2019t seem intimidating \u2013 it will seem clearer and easier for you to understand. You don\u2019t have to worry about fitting everything in, as you can see your full schedule and arrange it as you please.\nHow To Adjust Your Schedule: Choose the device you are most comfortable with and use the most, whether it is your smartphone or a notebook. Keep it on you all day while you are at work, so you can adjust your plans accordingly throughout the day.\n\u00A06. They Understand Teamwork\nMany of the most successful companies in the world were started with teamwork; Google was founded by Larry Page and Sergey Brin, Apple was founded by Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak, and Paypal was started by a team of five.\nBeing successful is rarely about being completely independent \u2013 successful people are able to work with others, able to compromise, and accept other ideas.\nHow To Adjust Your Schedule: If you work in a team alongside others, schedule an email chain with your co-workers. Make a note to email your co-workers at lunchtime if you do work on a project for feedback. This will help your team to feel involved, encouraging them to share their opinions and get involved.\n\u00A07. They Take Their Work Seriously\nSuccessful entrepreneurs truly believe in their work and see value in what they do. It is difficult to work productively and become successful if you don\u2019t believe in your work.\nIt is important to stay motivated and not to get side tracked by people who don\u2019t believe in you \u2013 remember that if you believe in your work, you shouldn\u2019t need the reassurance of others.\nHow To Adjust Your Schedule: At the end of your working week, set aside half an hour to review your goals and dreams, and see how you are progressing towards them. This will help you to achieve your goals, but more importantly \u2013 it will encourage you to truly believe in your goals.\n\u00A08. They Relax When They Are Done\nWorrying about work while you\u2019re not there can run you down, and actually make you less productive when you start again. Author Tim Ferris recommends writing down your working goal for tomorrow when you finish work, as this will help you to feel motivated for the next day \u2013 so you can actually switch off for now, and enjoy your evening.\nHow To Adjust Your Schedule: Write down three goals you want to achieve during your next working day. Write down how you will achieve them too, as this will help you to feel focussed, so you can switch off and enjoy your down time.\nOriginally published on LifeHack.org\n"
