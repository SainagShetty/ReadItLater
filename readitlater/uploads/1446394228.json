    "text": "A recent article in T, the style magazine of The Times, celebrated entrepreneurs \u201Charnessing goodness through technology.\u201D The article, headlined \u201CThe Transformers\u201D in print, was written by Laura Arrillaga-Andreessen, who is not a Times staffer.\nRosalind Paaswell of New York City was one of many who wrote to me about it, questioning an apparent conflict of interest in the section about Brian Chesky, the chief executive of Airbnb.\nMy question is about an undisclosed conflict: Ms. Arrillaga-Andreessen is the wife of Marc Andreessen, a substantial investor in Airbnb. Since the article reads as uncritical P.R. for the company, should readers have not been informed of this connection? I don\u2019t know what Mr. Andreessen\u2019s holdings in Airbnb are currently, but there is a definite connection that all should have known. The article mentions briefly that the business is being contested by \u201Cthe hotel industry\u201D spending \u201Cmillions to combat\u201D it \u2013 the big, bad hotel industry, of course. It is clever of Mr. Chesky to frame himself as the target of a big, bad corporation, ignoring other legitimate criticisms. But good journalism would not have left it at that.\nIn other words, the author of the article is not only married to a major player in the tech world, but one who is a major investor in one of the companies she featured. As Ms. Paaswell wrote, there was no disclosure.\nThe larger question is whether Ms. Arrillaga-Andreessen should have been chosen to write the article at all, given this conflict.\nI asked T\u2019s editor, Deborah Needleman, to respond. She wrote:\nI disagree that we shouldn\u2019t have let Laura write, as she is a separate person from her husband with her own career and credentials, having created a program for philanthropic study at Stanford. I sought out her opinion for those reasons, but agree that we should have had a disclosure, and it was my mistake in not asking her if there were any potential conflicts. This was an oversight on my part. I say this not as an excuse, but she is, separately from her husband, a billionaire (making her through marriage a billionaire twice over) and for that reason I think I failed to consider any monetary conflict in her case. Had I done that, I would have thought twice about the Airbnb mention, but as I believe in her expertise and opinion, might still have wanted to run it, but absolutely would have included a disclosure.\nAs TechCrunch reported in 2011, Mr. Andreessen\u2019s firm led a $112 million investment in Airbnb.\u00A0And Business Insider in May described his impact on the growth of new companies: \u201COne of those companies is $10 billion Airbnb, which was still a bumbling startup when Andreessen led its Series B round.\u201D\nMy take: This is a case in which the financial conflict is so clear, and the spousal tie so close, that a disclosure would not have been enough. A different writer altogether would have been a far better idea, and, to my mind, the only right one.\nWhat\u2019s more, the article was extremely favorable to these \u201Cmost visionary entrepreneurs.\u201D In fact, one of them, Elizabeth Holmes, was\u00A0also hailed\u00A0as one of \u201CThe Greats\u201D in the same issue. (She, along with Jonathan Franzen and Quentin Tarantino, among others, was\u00A0described in a headline as \u201CGreatness, Personified.\u201D) In contrast, only days later, Ms. Holmes\u00A0was the subject of a tough-minded\u00A0Wall Street Journal investigation into the serious problems of her company, Theranos. That kind of expos\u00E9\u00A0is not T\u2019s mission, of course, but the magazine is still part of The Times\u2019s journalistic offerings, and should\u00A0live by\u00A0the same\u00A0standards.\nOnline, the article now carries a disclosure about Mr. Andreessen and a\u00A0link to news coverage of\u00A0Theranos, and an editors\u2019 note has appeared in print.\n"
