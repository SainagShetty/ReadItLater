    "text": "For that reason, I won\u2019t limit what sports my children are allowed to play, and if they show an interest in, say, football or martial arts, I will do all I can to support that passion, while coaching them to play safe. Because hockey, specifically, is such an important part of my husband\u2019s life, I\u2019ll be signing my kids up as soon as they are old enough to join the Timbits league. \nOne could argue that aggressive sports teach kids focus, mental and physical toughness, resilience, discipline, commitment, and the value of competition as a catalyst to success, but there are plenty of other ways to teach these life skills, without making your kid someone else\u2019s punching bag. Obviously, every activity carries some kind of risk, but injuries are the exception, rather than the rule.\nWhat if, years from now, little Millie begs to give boxing a whirl? We\u2019re not out to raise a bubble baby, but there\u2019s a difference between allowing Millie to take her lumps and intentionally putting her into harm\u2019s way. So the answer will still be no. While Millie is under our care, we are in charge of her safety and well-being. Dabbling in violence is just not an option.\n"
